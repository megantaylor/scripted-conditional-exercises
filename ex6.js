/* You know how you have to log in on lots of web sites and apps? We're going to make a basic log in screen. */

// PART 1
/* Edit the code where it says "ENTER CODE HERE" so that the log in works properly */

}

// PART 2
/* Instead of using "prompt", edit the HTML so that a user can enter their username and password there. */

// PART 3
/* Instead of displaying the success or error message in a link, display it on the page using JavaScript and HTML. */

// PART 4
/* Add multiple users with different usernames and passwords. Make the login work for all of them. Customize the welcome message so that it welcomes a user by their username (e.g. "Welcome, hva-student!") */

// PART 5
/* Edit your code so that a user can only try to enter their password 3 times, after which the login box disappears. */
